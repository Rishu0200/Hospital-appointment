## 🎯 Overview

Healthcare facilities face significant challenges with patient no-shows, leading to wasted resources and reduced operational efficiency. This project uses machine learning to predict appointment no-shows based on patient demographics and appointment characteristics, enabling proactive interventions.

## ✨ Features

- **Data Pipeline**: Automated data ingestion from Google Cloud Storage
- **ML Model**: LightGBM classifier with hyperparameter optimization
- **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow integration for reproducible experiments
- **Web Interface**: Flask-based application for real-time predictions
- **Containerization**: Docker support for easy deployment
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins pipeline for automated testing and deployment
